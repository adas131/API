#### Simple PHP app

Following PHP class allows for API interaction:  [phplib InPay](https://github.com/inpay/phplib-inpay)

To generate payment request just issue call to  `/invoice/create`. This method will generate payment URL which can be used to redirect customers to the payment gateway. It is also recommended to supply parameters with `callbackUrl`. This way you'll receive status POST form data notifications to your own service. Alternatively you can poll actively invoice status using `/invoice/status`

### Authentication
To be able to create payment requests you need to set up an account https://partner.inpay.pl and fetch your **API** keys

Attribute | Meaning
------------ | -------------
**apiKey** | Your public API key
**secretApiKey** | Your secret API key used for message signing and verification. Do not share with anyone

### /invoice/create
Method `/invoice/create` accepts following POST **form-data** arguments :

Attribute | Meaning
------------ | -------------
**apiKey** | `string` your public API key
**amount** | `float` amount in local currency `123.25`
**currency** | `string` local currency name. Accepted values: `PLN`, `EUR`, `USD`
**optData** | `string` optional urlencoded query string `key=value&key2=value2`, which will be added to a callback to your service

### Initiate payment
Redirect user to `redirectUrl`.

After succesful payment user will be redirected to `succcessUrl` or `failUrl`.

`callbackUrl` has a header attribute called `API-Hash`. It is a **SHA512** hash of all above attirbutes combined with your `API private key`.

Below a simple script that checks the signature of transmitted data signed by header attribute `API-Hash`:

```php
  function checkApiHash() {
    $secretApiKey = 'yourPrivateAPIkeySecret';
    $apiHash = $_SERVER['HTTP_API_HASH'];
    $query = http_build_query($_POST);
    $hash = hash_hmac("sha512", $query, $secretApiKey);
    return $apiHash == $hash;
  }
```
